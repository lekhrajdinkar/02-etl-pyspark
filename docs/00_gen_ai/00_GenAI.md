## Intro
- create new content such as text, images, audio, code, or video.
- AI "generates" new data that is similar to the **data it was trained on**.
- Most 
```
Text: ChatGPT generating human-like conversations, essays, or emails.
Images: DALL¬∑E creating images from text descriptions.
Audio: AI generating music or voice from a script.
Code: GitHub Copilot generating programming code suggestions.
```
## key technology
- **Foundation Model** FM
- **Large Language Models** (LLMs): 
  - AI model trained on massive amounts of text to understand 
  - and generate human-like language.
  - Can answer questions, summarize, translate, write code, and more.
- **Diffusion Model**s / GANs: Used for generating images and videos.
- Fine-tuning vs retraining vs Transfer learning

## Core Architecture
- Transformers
- epoch and weight (features)
- layers
- GRU
- LSTM

## GenAI tools and frameworks
### Python-based
- `diffusers` : 
- `TensorFlow` : fine tuning
- `LangChain` 
    - Python/JavaScript framework for building applications with LLM
    - integrate LLMs with real-world data (APIs, SQL, docs)
    - prg:
        - Document Q&A system (e.g., chat with PDF, DB, storage)
        - Chatbot with memory
        - Enterprise search engine (RAG pattern)
  
### more
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation
- Model fine-tuning (LoRA, PEFT)

### Cloud and MLops
- AWS Bedrock, SageMaker
- GPU-backed compute
- CI/CD pipelines for ML (MLOps)
- Prompt engineering

## more
- Vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Observability, latency, rate limiting
- Cost optimization and caching
