So now what I understood so there are lots of Machine learning models already exists 
    like IDP, Natural Language Processing, WaveNet, LLM, GAN And so many 
    help me list on all other models which I missed and most popular ones.
     
And  foundational model which are designed to adapt  change and are more creative to generate new content
and under the hood relying on other models which were already built in past one or two decades.

So list down all the models On which foundational models relied on and 
Also tell me The Python library which I can use to connect with those models.
 
 for example :
 There is a langchain Library to connect with LLM Model, so similarly do for rest
```
