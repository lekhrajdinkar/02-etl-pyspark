```
users.csv(1000000 record)
process above file with with pyspark dataframe.
perform ETL :
- load csv
- filter, tranformation, cleanshing, etc
- load into database-1(user-stage table)
- next load from user-stage to user table.

expose etl as fastapi
also use sqlachamy -> handle transaction commit and rollback and also batch processing

this is scenario in my organization.

----

PySpark ETL Pipeline:
    Load 1M records CSV file
    Perform data cleaning and transformations
    Load to staging table
    Then to final user table

FastAPI Endpoints:
    Expose ETL operations as REST API
    Support triggering ETL jobs

SQLAlchemy Integration:
    Handle database transactions
    Support batch processing
    Commit/rollback capabilities

```
