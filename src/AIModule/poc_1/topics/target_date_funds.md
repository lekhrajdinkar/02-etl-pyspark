A target date fund is a mutual fund that automatically adjusts its asset mix as the target retirement year approaches.
For example, a 2045 fund will be aggressive (more stocks) now and become conservative (more bonds) as it nears 2045.
It offers a hands-off approach for long-term retirement investing.
